The solution is to apply the base styles and pseudo-class styles separately.  For example:

```html
<button class="bg-gray-300 hover:bg-blue-500">Hover me</button>
```

This will apply the `bg-gray-300` class for the base state and the `bg-blue-500` class when the button is hovered.  Alternatively, you could use Javascript to handle such behaviour.
